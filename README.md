# AgriEthos - Blockchain-Based Agricultural Traceability

AgriEthos.com is a decentralized application (dApp) that enhances transparency, authenticity, and efficiency in the agricultural supply chain using blockchain technology.

## 🚀 Features
- **Farmer Registration & Crop Data Storage**
  - Farmers register and input details about their land, crop type, and farming methods.
  - Submissions undergo a review process before being recorded on the blockchain.
  - Smart contracts store authenticity data, verifying organic certification and ethical farming practices.

- **Harvest & Processing Tracking**
  - Crops receive a unique digital ID (QR Code) linked to the blockchain upon harvest.
  - Processing plants scan and update product details for quality compliance.

- **Logistics & Supply Chain Management**
  - Each stage of transportation and handling is logged on the blockchain.
  - Smart contracts trigger alerts for storage condition violations.

- **Retail & Consumer Transparency**
  - Consumers can scan QR codes to access the full history of a product.
  - Retailers verify product authenticity with blockchain data.
